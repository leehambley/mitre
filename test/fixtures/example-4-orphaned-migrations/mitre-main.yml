# # Please manage your own configs above this line for consistency # #
# One must provide a "mitre" configuration, this is
# where migrations are cached in a data store.

# Here we use the YAML "anchors" [1] feature
# to conveniently reuse the es-mysql configuration
# properties to store our migration information
# in our principle mysql instance.
